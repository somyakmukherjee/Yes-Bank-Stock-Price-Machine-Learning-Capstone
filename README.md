Yes Bank is a prominent Indian bank that has been in the spotlight due to a high-profile fraud case involving its former CEO, Rana Kapoor, in 2018. This project aims to explore the impact of this case on the bank's stock prices. It seeks to determine whether time series models or other predictive models can effectively predict the bank's stock closing prices over time. The dataset used for this analysis contains monthly stock price data since the bank's inception, including opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices of each month.

About Project:- Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The Main objective is to predict the stock’s closing price of the month

ABSTRACT:

Accurate prediction of stock market returns is a very challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of the financial stock markets. With the introduction of machine learning, time series forecasting, and increased computational capabilities, programmed methods of prediction have proved to be more efficient in predicting stock prices. In this work, regression techniques have been utilized for predicting the next day closing price for one company belonging to the Finance sector of operation. The financial data: Open, High, Low, and Close prices of stock are used for creating new variables which are used as inputs to the model.

The Yes Bank Data data is first extracted and then categorized to identify, analyze behavior data and patterns. Using this dataset in our Supervised ML-Regression project we found some relevant analysis which would help to predict the monthly stock’s closing price of Yes Bank to perform better. Data set - data_YesBank_StockPrices - contains observations regarding open, close, high and low prices of the yes bank stock from July 2005 – November 2020. Rows: 185 Column: 5 Date: It denotes the month and year for a particular price. Open: Open means the price at which a stock started trading that month. High: refers to the maximum price that month. Low: refers to the minimum price that month. Close: refers to the final trading price for that month, which we have to predict using regression technique.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, and converting data types as needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the stock price data to understand trends, seasonality, and any anomalies in the data.

Feature Engineering: Create relevant features or lag variables for time series analysis, which can aid in prediction.

Model Selection: Evaluate different regression models, such as linear regression and machine learning models like Random Forest or XGBoost, to find the most suitable model for predicting stock closing prices.

Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets, and train the selected model.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. Understand how well the model captures the variation in the stock prices.

Results and Insights: Summarize the findings, including insights into how the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor may or may not have affected Yes Bank's stock prices. Discuss the practical implications of the model's predictions.

This project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing Yes Bank's stock prices and assess the predictive capabilities of various regression models. The results may assist investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions regarding the bank's stock.
